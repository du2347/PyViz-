- Comparison of Sale Prices by Neighborhood: Analyzed and visualized average sale prices per square foot by neighborhood to identify investment-worthy areas.
- Interactive Neighborhood Map: Developed an interactive geospatial visualization using GeoViews, a part of the PyViz ecosystem, highlighting neighborhoods with high gross rent and sale prices per square foot.
- Data Interpretation: Derived insights from the visualizations to understand trends in rental income growth compared to sales prices and to identify potential investment opportunities in specific neighborhoods.
## Further Research & Final Remarks
Proptech, short for property technology, encompasses a wide range of innovative technologies and tools that are reshaping traditional real estate practices (Deloitte). These technologies include but are not limited to virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and data analytics. The importance of proptech lies in its ability to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in real estate transactions. By leveraging advanced technologies, proptech companies can streamline processes, reduce costs, and provide enhanced experiences for buyers, sellers, and renters alike (Deloitte). For example, the introduction of instant, one-click services for property purchase and rental, as mentioned in this research project, represents just one aspect of the transformative potential of proptech. In the current time period, characterized by rapid technological advancement and changing consumer preferences, proptech has emerged as a key driver of innovation in the real estate sector (Deloitte). The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of proptech solutions, as remote work and social distancing measures have reshaped the way people interact with real estate properties. From virtual property tours to digital contract signing, proptech solutions have become essential tools for navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic. While the success of proptech varies across different markets and sectors, there is growing evidence to suggest its significant impact on the real estate industry. Global investment in proptech reached $23.8 billion in 2020, indicating strong investor confidence in the sector's potential for growth and innovation (Deloitte). Additionally, a study by Statista forecasts that the global proptech market will reach a value of $7.3 trillion by 2027, underscoring the increasing importance of technology in shaping the future of real estate (Statista). As proptech continues to evolve and mature, further research is needed to explore its full potential and address key challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. By fostering collaboration between technology providers, real estate professionals, and policymakers, researchers can contribute to the development of innovative solutions that drive positive change and create value for stakeholders across the real estate ecosystem.
